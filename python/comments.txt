Actually, the US release uses the Paramount logo. (Either the 1995 or 2012 logo, depending on VHS or Blu-ray)
I hate that iceberg i hope it melted
A poor man&#39;s Speed 2: Cruise Control.
Short version of the movie
My all time favourite movie and my all time favourite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio ❤️
XFAVORR KIERO VER EN CASTELLANOOOOOOO
love that movie romantic and sadthumbs up
JAKE AND ROSE JAKE IS DED BIKAUSE JAKE IS FROZEN 😰😰
It&#39;s a shame about Bill Paxton....<br />35MM Films were the best.
Brock Lovett can now hold The Heart of the Ocean. Thank you Bill Paxton for the entertainment!
The movie was ridiculously amazing! ,💕
Rip Bill Paxton 😭
Leo&#39;s young is amazing 🌚
This movie is truly a masterpiece! Such a beautifully made film 😍😍😍
I still bet the love story of King Kong!!!
BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!
If indians were on the titanic,everybody would have survived
I cried so freaking hard
Disaster movies send me into more shock than a horror movie ever could.

I watched the movie so I know that the ship is going too sink.
I love Titanic! Its my fav movie! When I am not watching it I am watching this trailer over and over!
i loved this trailer ever since the first time i saw it, many years ago. im glad its out in HD looks awesome
Titanic (1997) 20th Anniversary. Who watch this movie in theatre 20 years ago ? (I was)
Don&#39;t wanna watch the movie because i will probably cry all fckn night
The studio was so confident in this film, they showed the entire movie in just 4 minutes. It certainly paid off.
eswar
Today is 19 years since this movie was released.
i still love this movie
I can&#39;t believe this movie is turning 20 years old next year.

Грандиозный трейлер

DICAPRIO
Maaaan this trailer shows you almost the entire film haha
To be able to watch movies full
this trailer have two or three delet scnes from the original film!
i love this movie old memories back when i was child handsome young leo
that so old ship and movie
I bet you this trailer scared so many people in the movies... oh my god..
i love Leo DiCaprio😍💜
the perfect combination of love and drama ever🔥🔥
The first time I watched this movie, I REALLY loved it, but it was because I ignored all the romance in it and were more interested into the tragedy and the sinking itself. Now looking back at it, I feel like this would have been better if it did have all that romantic trash in it.
This is my favorite movie😪😭😭😭😭it&#39;s just so sad,I watched this like a million times before and I still cry😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😓😓😓😫😫😫😫😫😫😩😩😩
this is the movie which i have watched for many times, and it was  the same feeling when i first watched titanic. the feeling of true love that you couldn&#39;t even go without him &lt;3
I just watched this movie now and it&#39;s beautiful. I seen it years ago, but just a little bit. Such a sand ending and cute romantic moments between these two! Also the ending would have been nice if she jumped off the ship at the end, instead of throwing the necklace and both meeting in heaven. Still a 10/10 movie. The fountain will still be my favourite movie of all time..
I love the movie Titanic it&#39;s so sad❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😿😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😽😽😍😽
ICEBERG RIGHT AHEAD!
it&#39;s just an opinion.But I don&#39;t like this film at all.Yeah,maybe a couple of scenes can be saved.But I hate this so much tho,my favourite love story EVER will always be Romero and Juliet (The 1996&#39;s one,with DiCaprio) :D
Nothing could come between them. Not even an iceberg
wow
same dood gegaan daar Ben ik blij om 😢❤
should called it white titanic

James Horners superb Soundtrack influenced other Movie Soundtracks - as did the Film. &quot;Where did you get that&quot; someone once asked in another Film - and while People flock to see their fave Movies - every Narative comes from somewhere.

hey guys go to search in youtube (roblox titanic trailer)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m56s">1:56</a> THAT GUY POOR GUY
In the movie i was crying on the final of that movie, but the trailer, when i feels that music, is so slow and good and melodic, WOW. it´s feel something inside us. :,(
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> this scene kills me, completely.
I&#39;ll never be able to watch this again the way I did. Bill Paxton&#39;s death was a real deal.
K CRYIED
you people don&#39;t like this movie for get you guys
Am I the only who watch this trailer like I don&#39;t know what gonna happen even if I saw this movie thousand time ? 😍
Its so sad like if you agree
I went to watch this in 2012 with my mum it was so emotional
😭
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m33s">1:33</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> really makes me cry,  that old couples were to weak to get up ang get to a life boat.<br />And I will see the movie soon and I wanna ask did Rose survive?
Watching Titanic in 97 was the best movie experience I&#39;ve ever had in the cinema, but when I watched it on DVD I was disappointed, it didn&#39;t have the same impact, I guess it&#39;s better to be watched on the big screen
This has got to be my favourite film of all time💔💔makes me cry every time😪
it really makes me really happy because I want to see it yikes
perfect movie
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m47s">1:47</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ6klONCq4s&amp;t=1m49s">1:49</a> 😢😢😭
...
I like the soundtracks with the bells!! &lt;3 Any chance for a mp3 download? :D
100000%
Truly the best piece of art for all times.
I love the way the bell syncs with the song mhwgo
This is why I have a phobia of boats!
Best film ever
He said to never let go dammit!
I&#39;ve never watched this movie without being able not to cry.

most overrated movie made ever.
I&#39;ll never forget seeing this movie in theaters to the hour of 100th anniversary of the sinking. I was so surprised to hear so many people still weep at the sad scenes. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it was the best way I could&#39;ve honored those who died in the event that has/will always fascinate me.
i cry every time i watch this
I&#39;m glad I went to see it in 3d. Best experience watching a movie in theater.
the  song. is   good
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but I can&#39;t stop laughing at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVrqfYjkTdQ&amp;t=1m28s">1:28</a>

Awww... I remember I saw this movie back when it came out in theaters, I was only 7 at the time. I BAWLED my eyes out when the elderly couple was laying on the bed. I knew they were going to die. That was the first time in my life that I realized not everything has happy ending. I felt like I got punched in the stomach 😢😭😞
good trailer
You better shut up
You better shut up
good movie
This is a action movie this was not real people like rose and jack they were acters they weren&#39;t on the titanic
C&#39;est Magnifique ce film ♡
Celine dions voice gives me goosebumps
I was born in 1991 and when I first saw this thing I was like in elementary school and some scenes creeped the shit outta me, say ship cracking into half. And then as I grew up I had watched this film countless times now its been being my top fav film for 20 some years and I dont think it will ever change.
😭😭
When I first time watched this movie I cried
This movie never gets old! Feels like the first time!
Great trailer, congrats 🎈🍾
This movie is so beautifully sad :(
I regret not seeing this when it was re released. I hope it gets re released again soon so I can see it how you&#39;re supposed to see this movie
this is the best but saddest movie i ever seen

I can&#39;t put how much I love Jack into words...just can&#39;t
I get chills every time
I watched the movie and I love it I also watch the deleted scenes
James Cameron needs to remake this film with the iPhone 7 as Rose.
Make one where jack gets saved from drowning and they meet and have kids
Is it just me or did anyone else fell sorry for the old couple on the bed 😰
19 years later and it&#39;s still the world&#39;s most beloved and acclaimed film of all the time
Excellent. One of the best anime movie ever!!!!! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
One of the best and most beautiful trailer of all time
The best film forever❤️ my film already, when I was a little💞 my life this film

this is where the world of fantasy began
What&#39;s the song at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVrqfYjkTdQ&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a> ?
Titanic is the best movie!!! I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.its just amazing. incredible trailer
titanic is sinking...<br />Jack: Do not let go my hand<br />Rose: I&#39;ll never let go...<br />Will someone or some movie ever top that sentence? NO, I don&#39;t think so! :)
we will never have a movie like this ever again...<br />today&#39;s movies are such trash and just for money making i am so disgusted .<br /><br />Thanks James Cameron, you really are a genius,
Wow amazing trailer
Is it safe to say I actually cry every time I watch this movie, absolutely love it😢😢

This movie made me cry i just love the romance
Titanic 2 was one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever watched in my entire life.
Titanic 2 very badly because they use a lot of computer garfik
uma bosta
is that suppose to be fun ?
The only thing sinking is this movie. Sucks ass
This makes Sharknado look like an Oscar contender...
is dis trye or fan made
More like poisidern than Titanic<br />MOVIE IS CRAP
queen Elizabeth 1?
A STUPID MOVIE!
it was kind of obvious that it would sink plus the trailer is better than the movie
Still can&#39;t be compared to Titanic - Leo and Kate, until now..
wow i so exited
titanic 2 is sailing  in 2018from dubye to china omg
Wow. i MUST watch it
IF ANY OF U ARE FREAKING OUT CAUSE YOU ONLY JUST FOUND OUT(MY HEART MISSED A FEW BEATS)THIS IS FAKE
I am sorry. How does that look like Titanic??
im waiting
The queen Mary looks nothing like the titanic also how did the queen Mary turn into the titanic all of a sudden?
the only thing missing is sharktopus then it would be perfect
jack is back &#39;-&#39;
worst trailer ever
they used the queen Mary witch is at long beach California its a old ocean liner but now its used as a hotel
ITS NOT SS TITANIC ITS RHS TITANIC..the TITANIC is so sad if they would have brought banoculers they wouldn&#39;t have sunk.i can&#39;t spell today
literally I can&#39;t!
Titanic 2 looks much more dramatic than the first one.
This movie is honestly amazing wtf u all talking about???
This is not Titanic 2. This is Queen Mary
This movie is so pathetic, the CGI and water effects are worse than the movie from 1997
Is this real or a fake story? I guess 70% it&#39;s fake
if the first one was based on a real story is no such thing as a number two 2017 this movie still shit
my god this is cringy
nice photoshop
The queen Mary looks nothing like the titanic
and now titanic 3
is that the queen mary not the titanic 2
fake =v
oh great it&#39;s by asylum
and now titanic 3
was this a sci-fi movie?
You know the dirt appearance of titanic in this video wasn&#39;t titanic, it was Queen Mary
It sank teh end
OK name of that film looks like a cheat to me... I wonder how they used the name Titanic after a big budget movie. I know the name orginally belong to the ship, but the giant production companies of the 1998 Titanic movie(paramount&amp;20th century fox) didn&#39;t buy owner rights of &quot;Titanic&quot; title? Why some small companies able to use the name Titanic 2 like it&#39;s an after story of 1998 movie? I mean they called this Titanic 2, but where is their first Titanic movie? Are they using this title because the real Titanic sank on 1912 and this movie about the ship named &quot;Titanic 2&quot; ? This is cheating... If i saw the Titanic 2 posters in the theater i could think it&#39;s connected with James Cameron&#39;s Titanic movie. Most people thinks that first place. And of course producers knows that too... This is why they picked this name... This movie&#39;s success hopes based on a cheap trick. I think that those small production companies  should focus more original stories if they want to rise their names.
1.8 ratings. 0/10
did anyone else hear &quot;Dietanic 2&quot; ?
I doubt that the real titanic 2 would actually sink, after all the mistakes we people have made with ships I doubt titanic 2 would sink from another mistake
Omg this is so stupid
suck movie
SEE WHY THE FUCK....ugh just.....I&#39;m so mad....WHERE THE FUCK IS LEONARDO DICAPRIO????
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT44DYhGOnM&amp;t=0m12s">0:12</a> oh look, it actually looks like the titanic!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT44DYhGOnM&amp;t=0m15s">0:15</a> wait wth, did it just change completely?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT44DYhGOnM&amp;t=0m23s">0:23</a> ok wtf?
WTF I didn&#39;t know they came out with a Titanic 2 I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t know That
really same shit again.....trying to make me cry ..........
With the Titanic II actually being built, set for completion in 2018, hopefully this film isn&#39;t a bad omen.
this is posiedion
Shit complete shit
Whhhhhhy

If the titanic 2 went the same course and sank at the same place then wouldn&#39;t it crush the original titanic wreackage
It had to be THE ASYLUM best cough cough shittiest movie I&#39;ve seen cough cough quality I&#39;ve seen
What does this even mean there is no love story so why is it why is fate repeating

Honestly nothing and I mean NOTHING is better than Titanic and this stupid trailer for a &quot;Titanic II&quot; is the worst thing I have ever seen
well, history repeats itself.
This is a shit
Is it real?
very well put together but in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT44DYhGOnM&amp;t=0m03s">0:03</a> i could tell the ship is the Queen Mary 2
boa sorte e sucesso sempre que precisar de algo mais me ver livre e espontânea para o meu iPhone usando o seu contato com o meu iPhone iniciar a produção da arte
lol I managed to get this from netflix once, it&#39;s basically people falling and screaming down a deck at a 35 degree angle
Don&#39;t have a jack dowson (Leo)
These is so false. At the first scene they used the queen Mary ship and then they use a stupid computer animation
Titanic 2 really really did make history it was so tragic<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(How did I not hear about it!?)
Wow
Qui c&#39;è stato favij per la reaction di Titanic II  e per il video &quot;i sottotitoli di YouTube . Lui probabilmente l&#39;ha scaricato su PC ...
That is not titanic 2 I so the movie titanic in the movie was rose and Jack and people jack on the end he frozen in the water rose survive that is not real rose and not real jack in titanic the movie  in goggle I saw the original real rose and real jack rose died in 1937-2010 she died in 2010 rose and Jack are dead from titanic is jack rose in 2010 because she was old.

TITANIC 2 were not remaking the original film
non rovinate il titanic con sta merda di film
ANCHE VOI CON L&#39; ASYLUM?! :(
Imagine if Titanic will be in 4D
I Always cry when i se The movie 
Best movie EVER !!
Couldn&#39;t handle it not in 3d. Not gonna handle it in 3d. Still though best film
2nd BITCH
This is the best of all the commercials :)

i was born in 1998, like this movie
I think Titanic is the best movie ever made

Love this movie
Jack was originally to be a marble stone sculpturing artist, but it was thought his tools and stones were to large to carry about the ship easily. So a compromise was made and Jack became a pencil sketch man instead. Rose would have been captured in stone.<br /><br />Raise the Titanic!   The sequel coming soon! <br />To a theatre near you. 
Celine Dions voice doesn&#39;t match her face
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6mMvBeEPT4&amp;t=2m13s">2:13</a> Aaaaand then the Downtown abbey creator made Titanic mini-series...<br /> <b>slow claps</b>
Leonardo DiCaprio or Leonardo da Vinci
so this Jack and Rose story wasn&#39;t ?
Please do Baz Luhrman&#39;s Romeo and Juliet!
did I hear it right??the voice over says leonardo da vinci..
Yes! HE REALLY DIDN&#39;T HAVE TO DIE WTF?

gkkkkk
Spoiler alert the ship sinks
This movie really sucked. Don&#39;t feel it deserved any of its Oscars. The CGI was so bad it was laughable. Lol. The acting? Subpar at best. Cheesy score and ran way too long. Big Meh!
This is the lamest honest trailer I&#39;ve ever seen it gave me hives and cringed me at the same time.
very hot seen
watched for the fourth time and still cried like a lil bitch
and that stupid f**king song that briefly tricked you into thinking Celine Dion was hot. I just died😁😂
Bill Paxton died
spoiler alert theyre still drowned haha

Lol its cool! The old titanic trailer
Ok before watching this I gotta comment TITANIC IS MY FAVORITE VID EVER
Titanic before: &quot;Oh Jack!&quot;<br />Titanic after: &quot;OH JACK!!&quot; <b><del>cries</del></b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lmao
He sort of did come back - via another Film. &quot;Where did you get that&quot; he asks in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; (Remember Rose being left on that Driftwood) - and while People flock to see their fave Movies - every Narative comes from somewhere. James Camerons epic 1997 Movie was no exception...... <a href="https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/memorabilia.html">https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/09/memorabilia.html</a><br /><a href="https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/more-memorabilia.html">https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/more-memorabilia.html</a><br /><a href="https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/titanic-more-than-just-love-story.html">https://metrowynn.blogspot.co.uk/2016/10/titanic-more-than-just-love-story.html</a>
такого я не ожидала
movie remix 😂😂
ITS STEVE ROGERS!!!
They just spoiled titanic for me
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don&#39;t mind watching it coz it&#39;s my childhood time favorite movie and it was sad to see jack dying and I guess movies shouldn&#39;t be so realistic as we are already living in a world with no miracles or ppl will call u mad if u even say u blv in miracles... atleast in movies it will be fun to watch...
So, why is the ice a perfect block? I mean it could at least just not be perfect. And how did rose come back but young but in the 1997 TITANIC Movie, at the end she died of old age when she was 102 or 101 and jack died of hypothermia. So in the 1997 TITANIC Movie they both die eventually but in the 2017 or 2018 TITANIC 2 Movie their both alive. And they should have gotten along just fine they never have fighted in the 1997 movie but in the 2017 or 2018 movie they fight like a million (it&#39;s just an expression) times they got the chance to be together again like they wanted but then they get it. It sounds like they don&#39;t appreciate that their wish came true they&#39;ve wished for about a century and then they get it but don&#39;t like it to much wishing for nothing. P.S. I&#39;m adding the 1997 movie + the 2017 or 2018 movie together like one movie all smushed together.
I&#39;m so sick of sherry zombie I love robs music and a couple of his movies but he needs to stop destroying amazing works just so his wife can can play act
what is the diffrace betwren chuck norris and jack anymore
So annoying smh

No echen a Pender la historia romantica por favor :(
fuck this shit<br />only music was good
is it real trailer?
LMFAO 😂
Cuando lanzan la segunda parte!
jack is back!
I AM HOWLING WITH LAUGHTER. Every time someone uses Jack&#39;s &quot;ROSE!!!!&quot; in an edit I laugh so hard. Out of context it just sounds hilarious. That, and this trailer makes zero sense and is completely disjointed... I&#39;m crying laughing.
oh my goodness.. just when you thought it was all over :-) wow over a decade later and whenever I hear that Titanic tune it brings me right back to my first love❤
how did i get to this from carving mangos

this sucks
you should.make.a video.when elsa and.jack are.on the.ship and.if.you doit ai will suscribe and like
Chris Pine is great as Jack Frost. I think it worked out wonderfully <br />that he voiced him. But if Leo had taken up the role, what is it with <br />his characters dying in water? That was heart breaking enough to see in <br />Titanic and then they did it again in Gatsby. :&#39;( Anyway, amazing editing on the <br />Trailer:) Beautiful. Elsa and Jack even match Rose and Jacks character traits.
Never let go of my hand
i love that video so much
una historia romantica
Elsa has magic powers,she wouldn&#39;t let him go because of an iceberg.<br />The cold never bothered her anyway.

Jack <del>Dawson</del> Frost: &quot;You must do me this honor. Promise me you&#39;ll survive. That you won&#39;t give up, no matter what happens, no matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Elsa, and never let go of that promise.&quot;
I&#39;ve read a fan fic about Jelsa on the Titanic, this made my life complete. Slightly sad, but complete. ♡
Je l&#39;adore cette video a chaque fois que je la regarde elle me donne des frissons dans le dos J&#39;ADORE ous simplement magnifique·♡♡♡
there is no part 2
why now that is not playing at the cinema?I think that it is fake<br />sorry my English isn&#39;t very well because I&#39;m Greek
Also the characters are not the same ones i don&#39;t like it
In the movie jack and rose die sooooooooooooooooo
creepy at the end
que dia
This makes no sense
<b>Fake.</b>
Guys read the description
I don&#39;t believe this
Mais eu adoro titanic 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
Muito triste e se filme 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jack is alive ?!!!!😍😍😱😱😱😭😭😭
Thats fake i saw that movie that was not rose its all about older woman who inlove with that young boy.
I know this is just a movie but I wish the director made it so Jack lived like the real Jack in the real titanic.
like seriously this is information we dould of used years and years ago their both dead anyay past is in the past we need to move on their both in haven together who does this we could of used this!
Why did Jack do that? Swimming across Atlantic Ocean? So, when Rose called him to wake up, he didn&#39;t open his eyes and answered Rose? If he was still alive, I think he would wake up, happy to see a boat and help Rose to call the boat. I think we don&#39;t need Titanic 2, because it can&#39;t be moving like part 1. In part 1, we both cried, we were moved because of the dead of Jack and the love of them. So, although this video is fake or real, I am not agree with it at all
How can Jack breathe under water
So stupid all the scens of the movie is form THE READER what a fake pffff
Fake
college is shit. just saying ^^
some one said there should be a sequel to Titanic, like (jack is back) or (if Jack didn&#39;t die) , the directors thought the same<br />look better, you see there&#39;s this revolutionary road.
just saying<br />^^
i have to go to college tomorrow. it&#39;s shit
what did you use? Imovies to edit video? did it take you a whole day or 2 seconds?<br />this is shit. why does the quality differ every <b>**</b> second? couldn&#39;t you at least make the scenes look better. wth. i&#39;m glad nohing like this is the real Titanic, I would never watch it
This trailer is fake I&#39;m on iPad so I can&#39;t show a link to the real trailer when jack is alive and rose is a dead cause you can survive in ice for about 999999 years so yeah there is a real titanic 2 but rose dies of old age
New York City is where the titanic destination is anyway.
she should have been pregnet that would been a great secret other them long saggy tits in that dam nightie
this is where Trump family came to America
They r different people
FAKE

FAke
Everyone this is fake their is not going to be a titanic 2
omfg bullcrap the characters look different,sound different and rose wouldn&#39;t say that because she love jack duh duh
the rose&#39;s secret does not make sence
stop putting the white words it makes me cringe
I think From the surface would&#39;ve been sooooo much better than this and the actual titanic 2
Listen you sarcastic naysayers, this was made for fans of the original movie; don&#39;t like it? Tough shit, STFU and go watch something else. SMH
it&#39;s 100℅ fake
what was the ending?
What???? OMG 😦 Is this real? I didn&#39;t know that titanic 2 existed
is rose alive somebody tell me
the music alone makes me wish they would make this movie lol
just fake

idiotaaaaaaaaaaaaa
no entiendo
omg im dying!! this is funny af!! lmaoooo
WoW
wow !!!gut you MAKE the mobile in GTA??
OMg why
hi but I&#39;m not trying to be mean or anything but rose looks sexy and nasty
Lol jack and rose Michael as jack Trevor as rose Lol there really Kate WILSET and Leonardo dicaprio
Roses face looks like a boy😂
The fact that they used Trevor instead of some girl is the best part. It would have been way less funny that way. Then it would have been just another Titanic Trailer remake amongst others. At least this is different. :)
pause at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIzi83NObSM&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a>
good vid but JESUS CHRIST WTF TREVOR IS UGLY !!
kkkkkk
Try added a interior to titanic so now you can go inside of it but not all of the interior is inside the grand staircase and second staircase is there, looks realistic so since they added that there going to probably run more updates on titanic to where it&#39;s complete but there issue is probably the water dynamics cause the engine room floor was under water level so if water dynamics were put into GTA then all of titanic will be completed
ICEBERG RIGHT AHEAD
If I got the titanic mod I&#39;ll use it online so people can board the ship, and then maybe purposely sink it
Why did you put Trevor as the Heroine it looks Ridiculous, you should have put Tracey or Amanda.
I love the titanic 😢😢 it make me cry allllllll the time and the song😭😭😭😭😭😭😭like if u cry
I love the titanic 😢😢 it make me cry allllllll the time and the song😭😭😭😭😭😭😭like if u cry

cant wait for full version! this game is amazing! i have tried the demo, and o my good! im impressed good job!
how close to the goal are you?
the titanic is from my algoodoo one
Will there be passenger in full version??
they could have put some people in the game.. it looks empty...
Why are we the only one on the titanic...
I have is game
como se llama el juegooo
OMG
don&#39;t watch this at night 😨
VR with this BAdass
SCARY
they do know honour has a u in it right ?
This is way, WAY creepier than anything i have seen in videogames so far.<br /><br />Well done gentlemen.
I&#39;ve played titanic honor and glory... it&#39;d amazing! I can&#39;t wait for thid!
It&#39;s not FNAF music, it&#39;S music Titanic probably played back in the day.
I must know, Mr. Gautier... where did you find this gameplay?
I&#39;m obsessed with Titanic but have a fear of water and drowning<br />why do I do this<br />i don&#39;t know
anda a la mierda
Please tell me &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; plays when you&#39;re on the main deck. That would be amazing! It&#39;s also my favourite moment in James Cameron&#39;s film.
I love the horn blowing at the end
if you think about it, it kinda is a horror game because they are trying to recreate the horror that went on that night. I am glad they are doing something to help us remember that glorious ship and her passengers.
More like Titanic: Horror and glory! How utterly terrifying, and amazing at the same time. Imagine what the real passengers felt, being locked behind cage doors in 3rd class with no hope.
Just needs a leonardo dicaprio body floating around and it&#39;s perfect...
The graphics, details, clarity and everything.
OMG CANT WAIT!!!!
scary downloading the game right now loooool
scary downloading the game right now loooool
Add this on steam pleas
Haha why did you make it look like a horror game :) when its ready ill just chill, be amazed by the details and sink with da ship.
More like a eerie  horror  trailer version of the Titanic sinking
I want this on ps4!
I think the creepiest thing is that imagine being on the titanic with screaming people in a dark flooding room with a faint light from the farthest corner making an eerie light shining in the water
PS4 please.  I hope you can play either Rose or Jack :D!!!!
Looks really good, I&#39;ve had the idea floating around my head for awhile now of a game set on a sinking ship, its practically a horror game all on its own by the very idea and the way it can be implemented. Glad to see there&#39;s at least one such project that will let us experience this, not just the sheer terror and claustrophobia of a sinking ship, but the grandeur and beauty of the Titanic before her sinking.
me dio escalofrios
OMFG THANK GOD! I&#39;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GAME LIKE THIS! FINALLY!!!
is it bad that the sound effects creeped me out
I&#39;m guessing when the full game is released it will spawn you in a random cabin on the ship &amp; for a little while you can explore it &amp; meet all the passengers &amp; later the ship starts to sink &amp; there is a time limit for a certain deck to become completely flooded &amp; I can&#39;t stop but imagine the horror of being stuck below deck while the room u are in slowly fills with water &amp; you are left to go into a deep slumber under the sea in total darkness....oh &amp; you can find some drowned passengers lying or should I say floating around &amp; other people trying to escape too. Either way I am really excited especially for the way the graphics are done so it&#39;s a lot more immersive. (Downloading Demo Now :D)
wow I love the titanic plz make a Titanic map on gmod
Hello, <br />I hope this message finds you all well.. i would like everone which likes the titanic and WANTS TO REALIEVE THE MOMMENT OF ITS SINKING please look at this message and continue reading, there is this very and i mean very accurate game which is in development which is all about the titanic ! I can not decribe any further but i know its all about having your own story you can choose to be a third class passenger, a fireman( boiler room dudes), electrician, cleaner, maid anything and through out the &#39;journey&#39; you will be speaking to actaull ai which are still being programmed to say over 200 texts each! You can choose to save that girl which is stuck in third class or run away up the deck and save yourself, the choice is yours! I WOLD LOVE IT IF YOU COULD CHECK IT OUT PEASE <a href="http://www.titanichg.com/">http://www.titanichg.com/</a>
The music looks  five nights at freddys related 
First thing i&#39;m gonna do is lock myself inside a cabin and drown.  But i fear the waiting will turn into years.
It Looks Like In real life


It looks like in real life
It so scary
love the silent hunter 4 pressure craking sounds
very creepy. This will be the best game ever!!
i have been waiting like 7+ years a game finally came out like this and came out to be better than i excepted
So Hyped.
This is terrifying, and I can&#39;t wait.
Some of the lightning looks very realistic..... imagine a zombie appearing from the corner of the hallway.... that would totally freak people out.... this would be an amazing horror game experience!
This seems so promising! Does the ship split in half in the game?
This trailer looks awful, but graphics, animation and all looks so amazing!!!
gives that game in germany
What platform is this being released on?
The water, textures, lighting, EVERYTHING in this video looks great!
Damn that is the best first person experience of the sinking titanic
That was freaky
I&#39;m sh!ting myself
Wait, what? You can get inside of one of the Cabins on E-Deck in the demo? How?
Ah one more thing here how can i get my hands on that lovely creepy music box tune? i&#39;ve been looking for it but i just can&#39;t find one like it.
Gah-wah-ahh! <b>brain melts</b><br />In all seriousness, this really captured the claustrophobia and actually scared me a little.<br />I&#39;ll trade you my soul for a copy? :P
Since the lighting is in real time, (dark rooms with no light will be pitch black) do you get a light in those dark places? A lantern or flashlight?
AWSOME!!!!!!!
This really freaked me out, nothing has ever given me the impression of what it may have been like to be on the Titanic when it sank like this did.
Wonderful! Titanic &amp; Glory really should hire you as official trailer maker!
Ambiance flippante très bien rendue ! Brrrr !
